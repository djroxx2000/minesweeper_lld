This repository is a basic CLI implementation of the popular Minesweeper game where user is presented with a grid of squares where a subset of the squares within the grid contain a mine. The user starts out with a completely covered board. The goal of the game is to uncover all the squares of the grid one move at a time without ever landing on a mine.

The repository is setup to use Makefile to compile all Cpp sources present within the directory generating their object files as output all of which are finally linked together to create the executable to be run in the command line.
